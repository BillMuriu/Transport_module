# Authentication & Authorization Feature

## Overview

The Authentication & Authorization feature provides secure access control for the Safe Journey transport management system. It handles user authentication, role-based access control, invitation-based user registration, and session management across different user types.

## Feature Purpose

This feature ensures that:

- Only authorized users can access the system
- Users have appropriate permissions based on their roles
- New users can be invited and onboarded securely
- Sessions are managed consistently across the application
- Sensitive operations require proper authentication

   - Resource-specific access control

2. **Session Management**

   - Automatic token refresh
   - Secure logout functionality
   - Multi-device session handling
   - Session timeout management

3. **Invitation Management**
   - Create role-specific invitations
   - Track invitation status
   - Handle invitation expiration
   - Prevent invitation reuse

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Components

- **Login Form**: Handles user authentication
- **Invitation Forms**: Manages user registration process
- **Route Guards**: Protects routes based on authentication
- **Role Checkers**: Validates user permissions

### State Management

- **Auth Store**: Manages authentication state
- **Token Management**: Handles JWT storage and refresh
- **User Session**: Maintains user data and permissions

### Backend Integration

- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication system
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Server-side authorization
- **Invitation System**: Secure user onboarding process

## Security Features

### Authentication Security

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token renewal
- **Password Requirements**: Enforced password complexity
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly and Secure cookie settings

### Authorization Security

- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system
- **Route Protection**: Frontend route guards
- **API Authorization**: Backend endpoint protection
- **Resource Ownership**: User-specific data access

### Invitation Security

- **Token-Based Invitations**: Cryptographically secure tokens
- **Expiration Handling**: Time-limited invitation validity
- **Single-Use Tokens**: Prevents invitation replay attacks
- **Role Verification**: Validates invitation permissions

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration

- **React Router**: Route protection and navigation
- **Zustand Stores**: State management across components
- **React Query**: API calls and caching
- **Form Validation**: Zod schema validation

### Backend Integration

- **Django Authentication**: User management and permissions
- **JWT Implementation**: Token generation and validation
- **Email Services**: Invitation delivery system
- **Database Models**: User, role, and invitation storage

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors

- Invalid credentials handling
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Password reset workflows
- Session expiration management

### Authorization Errors

- Insufficient permissions feedback
- Graceful access denial
- Error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Role-based component loading
- **Caching**: User data and permissions caching
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Bundle Splitting**: Code splitting by user roles

### Backend Performance

- **Token Caching**: JWT validation optimization
- **Database Indexing**: User lookup optimization
- **Session Management**: Efficient session storage
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure availability

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Security Monitoring

- Failed login attempt tracking
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Invitation usage analytics
- Session anomaly detection

### Usage Analytics

- User login frequency
- Feature usage by role
- Invitation conversion rates
- Session duration analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
